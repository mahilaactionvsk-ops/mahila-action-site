// "API ID (Plural)". Strapi derives these automatically from the display name
// you typed when you created the type in the Content-Type Builder — so these
// MUST match what your project actually generated.
//
// ⚠️ VERIFY THESE before testing. To check the real value for any type:
//   Content-Type Builder → click the type → "Edit" (top right) →
//   look at "API ID (Plural)".
// Or just try the URL directly in your browser, e.g.:
//   http://localhost:1337/api/events
// A working endpoint returns JSON like { "data": [...], "meta": {...} }.
// A wrong one returns a 404 with a "Not Found" error.
//
// The one most likely to be wrong is TIMELINE — you named the type
// "TimeLineEntry" (capital L, capital E), which Strapi likely turned into
// `time-line-entries`, not `timeline-entries`. Fix the constant below if so.

Our legal literacy workshops have helped over 1,200 women access entitlements they previously didn't know existed.</p><h2>3. Mentorship Networks</h2><p>We connect emerging women leaders with experienced advocates who guide them through the challenges of public life. These networks have proven to be one of the most powerful tools for sustained participation and confidence-building.</p><h2>4. Young Women's Councils</h2><p>Recognising that leadership starts early, we run Young Women's Councils in 45 schools across Nalgonda and Warangal districts — giving girls a safe space to practise leadership, debate, and civic advocacy.</p><h2>5.

Our retention coordinators follow up monthly with families to resolve barriers and keep girls in school.</p><h2>4.
